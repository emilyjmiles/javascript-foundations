<!-- ABOUT THE REPO -->

## About The Repo

This repo contains practice exercises for the fundamental JavaScript concepts of classes and unit testing. There are two directories to explore. The original practice folder was created during the learning process. The revisited practice folder was created to solidify foundational JavaScript concepts after more advanced learning. 

There are lots of test suites in this repo! These test suites should are for improving problem solving skills. Each exercise emphasizes the fundamentals of object oriented programming in JavaScript.
